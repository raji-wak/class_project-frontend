# Detective-Themed Frontend - Design Documentation

## Overview
I've completely redesigned your detective app frontend with a **bold comic book/film noir aesthetic** that brings the detective theme to life with creative visual elements, animations, and a cohesive design language.

## Key Design Elements

### 🎨 **Visual Theme**
- **Film Noir Aesthetic**: Dark noir black backgrounds (#0a0a0a) with case file paper textures (#d4c5a9)
- **Detective Amber Accents**: Warm amber/gold tones (#f59e0b) reminiscent of old desk lamps
- **Evidence Red**: Dramatic red accents (#dc2626) for important elements and evidence markers
- **Case File Borders**: Multiple border layers creating that classic case file folder look

### 🎭 **Typography** 
- **Special Elite** - Authentic typewriter font for labels, buttons, and detective notes
- **Crimson Text** - Elegant serif for body text, like official case reports
- **Bebas Neue** - Bold condensed headlines for dramatic impact

### ✨ **Comic-Style Animations**

1. **Comic Zoom-In** - Pages appear with a comic panel zoom effect
2. **Panel Slide Left** - Elements slide in like comic panels being revealed
3. **Evidence Tag Pop** - Items pop in with a rotation, like evidence being slapped on a board
4. **Magnifier Scan** - The detective badge gently scans/moves around
5. **Case File Flip** - The detective card flips open like a case file folder
6. **Footprint Trail** - Subtle footprint animations for decorative elements
7. **Typewriter Reveal** - Headlines reveal with typewriter effect

### 🔍 **Detective Visual Elements**

**Case File Tabs**: "CASE FILE" tab on top of containers

**Evidence Markers**: Red star-shaped pins on list items (like pinning evidence to a board)
